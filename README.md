### Performance Optimizations

- Mobile-optimized touch interactions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Questions not loading**: Ensure `questions.csv` is in the root directory
2. **Authentication errors**: Check browser console for Firebase connection issues
3. **Malformed CSV**: Validate your CSV format and encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
4. **Mobile display issues**: Ensure viewport meta tag is present

### CSV Formatting Tips
- **Commas in text**: Wrap in double quotes: `"Hello, world"`
- **Quotes in text**: Use single quotes inside or escape: `"He said 'hello'"`
- **Line breaks**: Use `\n` for line breaks within text
- **Empty columns**: Leave blank but include commas as placeholders
- **Encoding**: Save as UTF-8 to support special characters

### Best Practices
- Always include the `QuestionType` column for clarity
- Test your CSV file with a small subset first
- Use consistent formatting for all questions
- Provide clear, helpful explanations
- Keep question text concise but unambiguous
