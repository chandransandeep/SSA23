136,multiple-choice,"Which two configurations must you make when you add a Split for Each shape to your case life cycle? (Choose Two)","Enter a unique name for the shape in the Split for Each field.","Define a condition to control when the flow runs for each iteration of the subprocess.","Enter the Page List or Page Group property that is the basis of the split.","Define when the parent process resumes processing.",,,,,C,D,,,,"A Split for Each shape fundamentally requires the Page List/Group to iterate over and a condition specifying when the main process should continue."
137,fill-blank,"You decide to use multiple pre-processing actions on a single flow action. Place them in the order in which they are executed: Run robotic automation, Apply data transform, Run activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Apply data transform,Run activity,Run robotic automation","Pega executes pre-processing actions in a specific order: data transforms first, then activities, then robotic automations."
138,text-input,"An SLA has an initial urgency of 20, ready after 1 hour. Goal is 5 hours (+10 urgency), Deadline is 8 hours (+20 urgency), Passed deadline is every 2 hours (+20 urgency, limit 5 events).
