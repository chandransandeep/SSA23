Here's the calculation: The initial urgency is 20. The case reaches the goal after 5 hours, adding 10 to the urgency, making it 30. Since the deadline is at 2 hours and has been exceeded by 4.5 hours, the urgency increases by 25, making it 55. Now, with the passed deadline events occurring every hour and increasing urgency by 5, after 1.5 hours, this would occur 1 additional time (since it's half an hour into the next hour), adding 5 to the urgency. Therefore, the total urgency after 6.5 hours is 20 (initial) + 10 (goal) + 25 (deadline)\n+ 5 (passed deadline event) =\n60. However, since the deadline urgency increase occurs at the 2-hour mark, the urgency would be 20 + 25 = 45 at 2 hours, and then after reaching the goal at 5 hours, additional 10 is added, making it 55, and then one passed deadline event adds 5 more, making the total 60. Since the deadline urgency is already accounted for at the 2-hour mark, it should not be added again after the goal.
